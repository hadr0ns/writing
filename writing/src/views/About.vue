			This is a very simple proof-of-concept for a digital writing center-style service, where students put in information about their assignment and the system provides resources that help them with the specific assignment characteristics they provided. The real thing will be made in Mendix at BYU, so I have left out some functionality here, because it would have been too difficult to implement it here and then implement it a completely different way in Mendix.
